## Backups Providers

For security we do not show here the backup services we used or have used in the past. They are available for any client that requests it.

## If you use a third party software: Plugins and themes.

If you'd like to use third party software like plugins with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties. We don't own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information. You should review their rules and policies when installing and using third party software.

## Updates to this list

We will do our best to keep this list updated but the best way to know which third parties affect your business is to request that information for your installation. We may need to confirm your identity to provide this information to you.
