## Role of the Parties

The Data Controller acknowledges that for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement, the Data Processor may have access to and may be required to process Personal Data (as defined in the Data Protection Legislation) on behalf of the Data Controller. By accepting the Agreement, the Data Controller authorises the Data Processor to process its Personal Data in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Ploicy.

The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, the Data Controller is the data controller, and the Data Processor is the data processor (where Data Controller and Data Processor have the meanings as defined in the Data Protection Legislation).

## 2.- Scope of the Processing

The Data Controller retains control of the Personal Data and remains responsible for its compliance obligations under the applicable Data Protection Legislation, including providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents, and for the processing instructions it gives to the Data Processor.

The instructions of the User are in principle conclusively stipulated and documented in the provisions of this Addendum. Individual instructions which deviate from the stipulations of this Addendum or which impose additional requirements shall require the data Processor written agreement. The data Processor will immediately inform the User if an instruction from the User infringes applicable data protection law.

Where the Data Processor is relying on laws of a member of the European Union or European Union law as the basis for processing Personal Data, the Data Processor shall promptly notify the Data Controller of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws unless those Applicable Laws prohibit the Data Processor from so notifying the Data Controller;


### 2.1.- Data processor obligations

The data processor certifies that it will not: 
(a) collect, retain, use, disclose or otherwise process the Controller Data for any purpose other than as necessary for the specific purpose of performing the services on behalf of the User; 
(b) collect, retain, use or disclose the Controller Data for a commercial purpose other than providing the services on behalf of the User; 
(c) process the Controller Data outside of the direct business relationship between User and the Processor; 
(d) combine the Controller Data with any other Personal Data the Processor collects (directly or via any third party) other than as expressly permitted for processors under Data Protection Legislation; or 
(e) “sell” or “share” the Controller Data.

### 2.2.-  Personal data types and processing purposes

The Processor processes Controller Data for the purpose of providing the website creation and management services to our Users. Controller Data is comprised exclusively of Personal Data relating to data subjects who use a User’s website, which may include a User’s customers, subscribers, followers, employees or other administrative users. Controller Data does not include content or Personal Data collected by the Processor about any of the foregoing persons in that person’s capacity as a user of WordPress.com or another service provided directly to the person by the Processor (including as specified in Section 2.7 and 2.8 below).

The type of Controller Data processed by the Processor depends on the services and features that the User decides to implement for the User’s website, and may include username and credentials; name; contact information, such as e-mail address, physical address, and telephone number; billing information, such as credit card data and billing address; website usage information, IP address, and other technical data such as browser type, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information; approximate location data (from IP address); personal information discussed in the content of the site or any content you upload, information regarding interactions with the website, such as “comments,” poll responses, “ratings,” and “likes”; and other information directly provided to the User’s website by a visitor to the website, such as contact form submissions. 

The duration of processing corresponds to the duration of the Agreement, which is described in the Terms of Service.


### 2.3.- User obligations

User shall comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws. The User is responsible for the lawfulness of the processing of the Controller Data. In case third parties assert a claim against the data processor based on the unlawfulness of processing Controller Data or any other violation of Data Protection Law by User, the User shall release the data processor from any and all such claims.

### 2.4.- Depersonalise data

User agrees that the data Processor may depersonalise (including through deidentification) the Controller Data or aggregate data in a way which does not permit the identification of a natural person, as well as use the data in this form for purposes of designing, further developing, optimizing, and providing its services to the User as well as to other users of the service, provided that if such data is “deidentified” (as defined under Data Protection Law), the data Processor will take reasonable measures designed to ensure such data cannot be associated with a natural person and will commit to maintain this data in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify this data except to assess the sufficiency of the deidentification. The parties agree that the Controller Data rendered depersonalised or aggregated as above-mentioned are no longer classified as Controller Data in terms of this Addendum and that the data Processor is instructed by User to depersonalise Controller Data in accordance with this clause.

### 2.5.- Other data

In some cases, the data processor may collect, use, and disclose any User data (“User Data”) which is distinct from Controller Data in accordance with the WPHercules privacy policy, which is available at https://wpherc.com/terms/privacy-policy/. User Data may include any information collected by WPHercules from or about a visitor to User’s website (including any contributor or editor). We may collect this data for internal security porpurses. The parties agree that WPHercules processing of User Data is independent of the services that WPHercules provides directly to the User for the User’s website, and is not subject to this Addendum.


## 3.- Personnel Requirements

The Processor shall ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Personal Data are obliged to keep the Personal Data confidential.


## 4.-Security of Processing

The Processor shall ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate, pseudonymising and encrypting Personal Data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services, ensuring that availability of and access to Personal Data can be restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures adopted by it);

The Processor shall have the right to modify technical and organisational measures during the term
of the Agreement, as long as they continue to comply with the requirements under Data Protection
Legislation.


## 5.- Support Obligations

If so reasonably required, the Data Processor shall:
- Assist the Data Controller, at the Data Controller's cost, in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments, and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;
- Notify the Data Controller without undue delay on becoming aware of a Personal Data breach;
- If so reasonably required, at the written direction of the Data Controller, delete or return Personal Data and copies thereof to the Data Controller on termination of the agreement unless required by Applicable Law to store the Personal Data; and

## 6.- Sub-processors

In accepting these Terms and Conditions, the Data Controller consents to the Data Processor appointing third-party processors of Personal Data ("the Sub Processors") under this agreement.

The Data Processor shall enter into a written agreement with the Sub Processors, incorporating terms substantially similar to those prior to appointing any Sub Processor.

The Data Controller accepts that for the purposes of this Agreement, part or all of its Personal Data may need to be processed outside of the UK or EEA.

The Data Controller shall have the ability to withdraw its consent to the Data Processor's use of Sub Processors for the purposes of fulfilling this Agreement by notifying the Data Processor in writing at its registered office. However, the Data Controller acknowledges that the Data Processor may not be able to perform the Services or any part of the Services unless it is able to appoint an alternative Sub Processor. If an alternative Sub Processor cannot be appointed, the Data Processor shall not be obliged to provide any part of the Services that are affected.

The Data Processor may, at any time on not less than 30 days' notice, revise this clause 3 by replacing it with any applicable controller to processor standard clauses or similar terms forming part of an applicable certification scheme (which shall apply when replaced by attachment to this agreement).

The Processor shall make available to the User the current list of sub-processors at the following link: https://wpherc.com/terms/privacy-policy/third-party-subprocessors/. User should check this website regularly for updates.
Through this link, the Processor shall provide notice to the User of any intended changes concerning
the addition or replacement of sub-processors. The User is entitled to object to any intended
change. An objection may only be raised by the User for important reasons which have to be
proven to the Processor. Insofar as the User does not object within 14 days after the notification
date, the User’s right to object to the corresponding engagement lapses. If the User objects,
the Processor is entitled to terminate the Agreement on reasonable notice.


## 7.- Deletion and Return of Controller Data

Upon termination of the Terms of Service the Processor shall delete all Controller Data, unless the Processor is obligated by law to further store Controller Data as specified on the Privacy Policy.

## 8.- Term and termination

This Agreement will remain in full force and effect as long as:
- The Services Agreement remains in effect or the Data Processor provides the relevant services to the Data Controller, or
- The Data Processor retains any Personal Data related to the Services Agreement and/or the services in its possession or control.

Any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication should come into or continue in force on or after termination of the Services Agreement or the provision of services by the Data Processor to the Data Controller (as may be applicable) in order to protect Personal Data will remain in full force and effect.

If a change in any Data Protection Legislation prevents either party from fulfilling all or part of its obligations to the other party, the parties will suspend the processing of Personal Data until that processing complies with the new requirements. If the parties are unable to bring the Personal Data processing into compliance with the Data Protection Legislation within 28 days, they may terminate the Services Agreement and/or the provision of services on written notice to the other party without prejudice to any right or remedy the parties may have under the Services Agreement or otherwise.

## 9.- Evidence and Audits

User has the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help to ensure that the Processor processes the Controller Data in accordance with requirements of this Addendum.
